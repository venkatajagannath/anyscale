    This function is a fork of subprocess.run with fewer args.
    The goal is to create a child subprocess that is GUARANTEED to exit when the parent exits
    This is accomplished by:
    1. Making sure the child is the head of a new process group
    2. Create a third "Killer" process that is responsible for killing the child when the parent dies
    3. Killer process checks every second if the parent is dead.
    4. Killing the entire process group when we want to kill the child

    Arguments are the same as subprocess.run
